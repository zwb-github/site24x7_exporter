A Prometheus compatible exporter for site24x7.com

## Features

This exporter currently supports these monitor types:

- URL "Website"
- HOMEPAGE "Web Page Speed (Browser)"
- REALBROWSER "Web Transaction (Browser)"

It also supports monitor groups and exposes them via labels.
Custom tags on monitors are exposed via labels as well.
Sadly, the API doesn't return custom tags on monitor groups so those are not supported.

```

## Using with proxies

If you need to use proxies in order to make the outgoing HTTP requests, you can set the environment variables
`https_proxy` and `HTTPS_PROXY` (the latter taking precedence). The proxy will then be used automatically.
You can see that a proxy will be used as the startup sequence will tell you so.

## How to use

### Preparation

First you need to create an OAuth 2.0 application as per https://www.site24x7.com/help/api/index.html#getting-started
For instance, go to https://api-console.zoho.eu (or your whatever your region's endpoint is) and then create a new
application of type "Self Client". Note the client's `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, you'll need them later.

Now it's time to get a refresh token. First, we'll need to generate a temporary code. In the "Generate Code" tab,
enter `Site24x7.Reports.Read` as the scope.
Choose a time duration of 10 minutes for the code and finally click "CREATE". You'll receive a temporary code.

In order to get your permanent refresh token, prepare a new file `curl-secrets` with these contents:

    client_id=your-client-id&
    client_secret=your-client-secret&
    code=your-temporary-code&
    grant_type=authorization_code
    
and then run this curl:

    curl https://accounts.zoho.eu/oauth/v2/token -X POST @curl-secrets
    
We use the `curl-secrets` file for security purposes so that your secrets won't be temporarily visible to all users
in a multiuser system.

Note: Remember to use your proper region endpoint!

You'll get back a response that looks roughly like this:

```
{
    "access_token": "some long token ",
    "api_domain": "https://www.zohoapis.eu",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "refresh_token": "we're interested in whatever is in here",
    "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Copy the value of `refresh_token` somewhere, we'll need it later.

### Run via cargo

The exporter expects to receive the OAuth 2.0 data via environment variables.
These are:

- `ZOHO_CLIENT_ID`
- `ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN`

Let's set them and spin up our exporter:

    export ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
    export ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
    export ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
    cargo run -- --site24x7-endpoint site24x7.eu
    curl http://localhost:9803/metrics

Alternatively you can add these environment variables to an `.env` file in this format:

    ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=your-client-id
    ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=your-client-secret
    ZOHO_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token

This is especially convenient for development purposes or local Docker usage as shown below.

### Run via docker

    docker run --env-file ./env svenstaro/site24x7_exporter --site24x7-endpoint site24x7.eu

### Testing

Try

    curl localhost:9803/metrics

and you should see some sweet metrics if everything is working fine.

### Troubleshooting

In case you get weird errors, try running with `--log.level debug` and then make a request
against the metrics endpoint. You should see a ton of helpful output. Be super careful though
as this **WILL EXPOSE SECRETS**. Do NOT run `--log.level debug` or `--log.level trace` for any
purposes except for local debugging.

## Usage in Prometheus

Make sure to not poll this too often as site24x7 has API usage limits per day.
The limit seems to be around 70000 per day so polling every 5 seconds should be safe.

Custom user tags are exposed as labels with a `custom` prefix. So for instance a tag with
key "hello" and value "there" would look like this in the output: `custom_hello="there"`

## Releasing

In order to release this, do:

- Increase version number in `Cargo.toml`
- `cargo build`
- Prepare `CHANGELOG.md` in keepachangelog.com format
- `git commit -am <version>`
- `git tag -sm <version> <version>`
